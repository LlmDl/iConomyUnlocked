## [iConomyUnlocked](https://github.com/LlmDl/iConomyUnlocked) - Developed by [LlmDl](https://github.com/LlmDl)

### Overview

iConomy's lineage dates back to the first years of Bukkit Plugins, created by Nijikokun. Having around 7 distinct versions, iConomy had its ups and downs over the years. At one point [iConomy 5](https://github.com/iconomy5legacy/iConomy) was taken over by ElgarL, and then ultimately LlmDl.

Known for its simplicity and resiliance, iConomy 5 served many servers well for years but it was time to abandon it once [VaultUnlocked](https://github.com/TheNewEconomy/VaultUnlocked) arrived.

VaultUnlocked finally adds proper UUID support to the VaultAPI. With that it is finally possible for plugins that use non-player accounts (like Towny,) to integrate with Economy plugins without using Vault's outdated named methods.

iConomyUnlocked has been created to give iConomy 5-using servers an exit path. It support both the VaultAPI and VaultAPI 2, meaning it will work with any Vault plugins and any Vault2 plugins.
